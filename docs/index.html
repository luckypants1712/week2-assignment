            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, 
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period. 
            Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source 
            of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
            Most peapole in Asia have chicken as pets all time!
