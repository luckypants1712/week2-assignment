            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, 
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period. 
            Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source 
            of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, 
            which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are 
            often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers.
